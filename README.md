**Finished but unpolished systems**

* Plugin loading
* Plugin execution
* API Key's
* Custom Plugin data
* Node UI (NEEDS TO BE REWORKED 100%)
* Saving and loading Results

**Known Bugs**

* After Searching the first time, a second Search will be overlayed onto the first Search
* After Searching the first time, then saving and loading, only the latest Search will be saved and therefore loaded. (Support for multiple Searches is not planned)
* Moving the Window can be buggy. I know why but i have no Solution yet
